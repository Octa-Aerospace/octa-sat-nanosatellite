# OctaSat
OctaSat is an open-source CanSat prototype designed for stratospheric flight developed by Octa Aerospace members in Chile. Our goal is to learn from our prototype experimental mission in order to develop a commercially-available educational kit for school students in Latin America.

Octa Aerospace is currently participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2021 competition. Check our [NASA Space Apps profile](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/near-space-near-you/teams/octa-aerospace/project) and our [website](www.octaaerospace.com)   


## How to replicate our prototype
OctaSat was programmed with python 3, you can clone this repository and read our code with any text editor (preferable Atom). Schematics and PCB files can be viewed and edited with KiCad. The Enclosure has been designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 and can also be edited and modified.

*To Consider: The Enclosure is incomplete, with no cap threading nor antenna and closed eye-bolt attachment holes added to the design.
